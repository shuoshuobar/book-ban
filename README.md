# Pulled off School Bookshelves: the Sweeping Book Removal Wave

## Goal:
Analyze and visualize the situation of book ban across the United States.

## Findings:
The past academic year has seen an unprecedented surge in book bans, reaching the 10,000 plus springboard for the first time, a significant jump from the 3,362 records of the previous year. State-wise, Florida and Iowa turned out with the most bans in the 2023-2024 school year. Book bans in these two states reeled from state legislation, taking together effect with initiatives from local districts. 

## Process of Data Collection:
Download the Index of School Book Bans datasets of the 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years from PEN America: https://pen.org/book-bans/pen-america-index-of-school-book-bans-2023-2024/.
   
## Process of Data Analysis:
1. Filter the top ten banned book titles of the three school years and research their subject matter.
2. Set up a treemap to visualize the division of the subject matter among top ten banned book titles from 2021 to 2024
3. Create a dataframe documenting the number of banned book instances by state and school year.
4. Map the instances of book bans by state in 2023-2024 using DataWrapper

## Skills/Approaches in Use:
1. Excel - data collection
2. Python - Pandas: data cleaning and analyzing
3. Python - Treemap making
4. DataWrapper: map plotting
5. HTML: Webpage with scrollytelling style

## Limitation/Looking Ahead:
1. I have tried hard using ggpattern with an image of a book stack but had a hard time fitting the often distorted image outlook.
2. Had I know how to use Illustrator, a pictogram of small book icons could be an interesting visualization.
